# README Generator

## Overview

This command-line application, designed for use within Visual Studio Code, facilitates the creation of professional README.md files dynamically. Leveraging the Inquirer package, it streamlines the process of crafting high-quality READMEs for GitHub projects, featuring sections like Title, Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
The application should prompt users for information about their project repository and generate a high-quality README.md file accordingly, containing essential sections such as Title, Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
```

## Getting Started

* Create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` so that your `node_modules` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your `.gitignore` file before installing any npm dependencies.

* Make sure that your repo includes a `package.json` with the required dependencies. You can create one by running `npm init` when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.

* Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.

* Refer to the [Fullstack Blog Video Submission Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide) for additional guidance on creating a video.

* Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers or other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.
