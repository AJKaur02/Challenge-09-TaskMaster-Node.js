# README Generator

## Overview

This command-line application, designed for use within Visual Studio Code, facilitates the creation of professional README.md files dynamically. Leveraging the Inquirer package, it streamlines the process of crafting high-quality READMEs for GitHub projects, featuring sections like Title, Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

## User Story
